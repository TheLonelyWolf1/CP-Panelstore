# About
This Repo is meant to be a Collection of PanelConfigurations for the MC Plugin [CommandPanels](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/commandpanels.67788/).

It's a side project of me and other volunteers to provide a safe space, on which you can download PanelConfigurations made by the community.

The Panel files are free of charge and can be changed to your liking

- Fork this repo
- Add your Configuration in the required [layout](https://github.com/TheLonelyWolf1/CP-Panelstore/edit/main/README.md#layout) to your fork
- Make a Pull Request(PR) to this repo containing your PanelConfiguration

> ***Only [original](https://github.com/TheLonelyWolf1/CP-Panelstore/edit/main/README.md#original-panels) Panel Ideas will be added to this repo***

# Layout
For easier navigation we require a certain layout of the files.

The Layout is as follows:

- Inside folder "panels"
  - Folder with the name of your Panel
    - images *- You should add Pictures of your Panel in here*
    - files *- Here you can add the .yml-files of your panel configuration*

# "Original" Panels
The Panels should be their own original Idea and not an exact copy of another panel with only small changes.

Example: We don't want 100 Server selector Panels which are only slightly changed from one another.

# Support
There is no support guaranteed for any of the panel files.
You can try asking for help in the Discordserver of Command Panels [here](https://discord.gg/eUWBWh7).

# Disclaimer
We are not liable for any damages caused by configurations of this site.
